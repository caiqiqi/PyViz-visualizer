# PyViz-visualizer
This folder is scratched from the visualizer source code in [ns-3](http://code.nsnam.org/ns-3.25).

## main change
I mainly changed the [core.py](core.py) and  [base.py](base.py) in order to 
- Change the color to distinguish nodes with wireless net devices and those with only csma net devices.
- Remove the gray circle initially appeared in the topology, which turns out to be a channel.
